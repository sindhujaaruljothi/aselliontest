# Asellion Backend Assignment

Create a Java-based application with one or more Servlets that accept the following commands:
* getProducts (returns a list of products in json format)
* addProduct (adds a new product defined in a json format)

The list of products should be created in a SQL database, if the database is empty, it should be created automatically.

The product object needs to contain the fields:
* id (pick something suitable)
* name (String)
* currentPrice (Amount)
* lastUpdate (Timestamp)

Use the frameworks as you see fit to build and test this and provide demo data.

### Implementation

As we are searching for a Junior Backend Developer, we know that this exercise might seem a bit overwhelming at first. We favor good working code over completeness. We expect this exercise to not take longer than 3 hours. If you are not able to finish, no worries â€“ but please tell us which parts you struggled with.

If you are able to, we favor to use git for version control. So if you can share the project you created over gitlab that would be optimal, otherwise just pack your sourcecode in a zip file and send it over to us.
