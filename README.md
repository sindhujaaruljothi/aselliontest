# Asellion Backend Assignment

Create a Java-based application with one or more Servlets that accept the following commands:
* getProducts (returns a list of products in json format)
* addProduct (adds a new product defined in a json format)

The list of products should be created in a SQL database, if the database is empty, it should be created automatically.

The product object needs to contain the fields:
* id (pick something suitable)
* name (String)
* currentPrice (Amount)
* lastUpdate (Timestamp)

Use the frameworks as you see fit to build and test this and provide demo data.
